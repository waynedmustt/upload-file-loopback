# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

1. First clone the repository into your dev and run ``npm install``. Make sure all of it run well. Then, run ``npm test`` to make sure all of unit testing pass the test.

2. Run ``node .`` then access using POSTMAN or any REST-API tools that support upload-file form data. 
Access ``http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/attachments`` then go rocks!

Feel free to any upcoming enhancements.
